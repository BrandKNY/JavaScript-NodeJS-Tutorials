# [Tutorial Guide] Introduction To NodeJS and Javascript

## Purpose of this Repository

Basically I am putting together a series of tutorial videos introducing programming in JavaScript using the NodeJS Runtime Environment. This repository will serve as a static site and source of information to complement the video tutorials hosted on YouTube. The videos are the primary focus, however it is often requested that some of the links, code, and other resources I use in those videos to be made available. Therefor I will be adding all of the relevant information and content here and organizing everything by video number / title.

## Branch Information
**Important** The benefits of using Git for this is the ability to maintain different versions of the tutorial that correspond to future changes. For example if a new version of NodeJS is released which invalidates one or more videos in the series due to deprecation of features in the APIs, while adding new/additional features to the APIs, then I can create a new branch for the new version of NodeJS and only update the information for the Installation of that new NodeJS version, remove or explain the deprecations in-place of the previous videos affected, and add additional videos + information to cover the new concepts and features.

Additional information can be found at the bottom of this page under the *Change Log* section.

Branch Name | NodeJS Version 
--|---|--
master  | v 6.7.0  
node-6_7_0  | v 6.7.0  

A nice, detailed breakdown of Javascript features supported by NodeJS versions can be found [linked here at http://node.green](http://node.green/)
